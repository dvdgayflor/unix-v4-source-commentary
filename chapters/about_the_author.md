# About the Author

**Briam Rodriguez** grew up in Little Havana, Miami, Florida. He attended Miami Senior High School, where he discovered Linux and recognized that serious systems programming required mastering C. His mother purchased a copy of *The C Programming Language* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie at a time when the family could barely afford it. That book became the foundation of his career.

He enrolled at Miami Dade Community College but left before completing his degree to support his family. He continued his education independently, teaching himself systems programming from source code and technical literature.

His early professional work included writing Linux kernel device drivers at Tangent POS, developing keyboard and display drivers for point-of-sale systems based on the Intel SA1110 StrongARM platform during the Linux 2.4 era. He went on to lead development of Congressional Moments for iPad, the Lexee voice assistant at Angel.com, and the Salesforce Cloud CTI integration. His experience spans kernel development, iOS applications, and full-stack web engineering, with production work in C, Python, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, C++, and assembly.

He holds five U.S. patents:

- *Systems and Methods for Maintaining Internet Protocol Address During and After Failover* (US-20240121697-A1, 2024)
- *Conversation Assistant* (US-10129720-B1, 2012)
- *Display Screen with Graphical User Interface* (US-D763863-S, US-D771643, US-D802613-S; 2016)

He currently serves as Senior Vice President of Engineering for the POTS In A Box offering at DataRemote, Inc.

This book represents both a personal debt and a professional aspiration. The debt is to Ritchie, Thompson, Kernighan, and the Bell Labs engineers whose work enabled his career. The aspiration is to provide what he once searched for and could not find: a guide to UNIX internals written with the clarity and concision that distinguished *The C Programming Language* — explaining not merely what the code does, but why it was designed that way.

The original UNIX authors wrote systems of remarkable elegance under severe constraints. This commentary is an attempt to make their thinking accessible to a new generation of programmers.
